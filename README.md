Hey Iâ€™m Owen!
I love to program and work on different projects that can hopefully have a positive impact on the world. Throughout the past few years, I've learned and made projects using a variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies, such as: Python, OpenAI, Tensorflow, Java, HTML5/CSS, Javascript, Swift, React and Discord.JS. 

Currently, I am learning some frameworks and technologies that will hopefully allow me to make some more cool projects in the future (such as a machine learning based Ring doorbell app), including:
- Custom neural networks
- MongoDB

In my free time, I also enjoy stargazing, going for walks around cities and taking photos, and meeting new people!
