Hey Iâ€™m Owen!

I am an incoming Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo who loves working on ideas that can hopefully have a positive impact on the world. Throughout the past few years of my coding journey, I have learned and made projects using a variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies, such as: Python, React, OpenAI, Java, HTML5/CSS, Javascript, Swift, and Discord.JS. Currently, I am working towards being a full stack developer by doing more backend with MongoDB, Express, and Node.JS. Apart from programming, you can catch me hiking through the mountains, stargazing (my favourite constellation is Cassiopeia), taking photos in the city, and meeting new people!
