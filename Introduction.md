Hey Iâ€™m @OwenTheEpicGamer!
I love to program in many different languages (Java, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript) :))
Currently, I am learning a couple new frameworks for front-end development:
- React
- Vue or Angular
- Bootstrap
- Discord.js

In my free time, I also enjoy learning science, taking hikes in nature and playing video games such as League of Legends, Genshin Impact and Valorant!
